Dear Mr.Manager (or whatever),

If you are thinking of suspending my account, please think again. I set up this site purely for personal use.
It only has a note taking page and a page to save my public ip at home (which is obviously public, so no harm
if I put it online). I have already been suspended once, and it took me quite a while to rebuild this site.
So please spare me and my little site because turning it off won't do you any good, and you would be doing
me a lot of favor just by keeping it alive. God bless you!
